Easily insert images from shutterstock into your posts

== Description ==

**The plugin is temporarily paused as shutterstock have introduced a paying model for their api. Due to this issue its no longer free to make a call to preview or download images from their website. All current users can ask for a refund, registrations have now been closed until further notice. We are working a new version that would allow users to use the plugin again. You can read more about the api changes here https://www.shutterstock.com/api/pricing**


*Immediately search, view, and insert high-quality Shutterstock images directly into your WordPress media library with the click of a button.*

ShutterPress was designed by creatives looking for a simpler way to populate their WordPress media libraries with up-to-date stock images without having to navigate from browser to browser.

The ShutterPress team shares this luxury with you by way of our latest plugin release. ShutterPress makes communication between Shutterstock and Wordpress to make media management easy.

Choose your license based on the amount of sites you want linked to your Shutterstock account and then initiate the one-time activation process.
